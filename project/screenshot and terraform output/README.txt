I deployed all infrastructures (EKS, RDS primary and secondary cluser ...) in zone 1 at 1 time. 
So screenshot "step4 and step6 - screenshot - terraform apply - zone 1.png" is result for step 4 and step 6.
For more detailed information, you (reviewer) can refer the output of command terraform apply in this folder.
Thanks
